As the npm's [docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/searching-for-and-choosing-packages-to-download#package-search-rank-criteria) says:

`Quality: Quality includes considerations such as the presence of a README file, stability, tests, up-to-date dependencies, custom website, and code complexity.`

✅ README file

✅ Stability - Released Major semver

✅ Tests - Added dummy tests

✅ Up-to-date Dependencies - Zero dependencies

✅ Custom Website - Pointed to our Organization website

✅ Code Complexity - Single `index.js` file with just `console.log()`
